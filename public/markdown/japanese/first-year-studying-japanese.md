Hi. This post is about my first year of studying Japanese and everything I learned along the way. I wrote this to track my language progress.

If you plan to learn a new language, this may serve as an inspirational starting framework so that you can avoid some of the mistakes I made.

---

## Background

I'm a 30-year-old full-time programmer from the Philippines. I am presently bilingual with Tagalog as my native language (NL) and a C2 level of proficiency in English. Currently, my Japanese is around A2 based on the [CEFR self-assessment grid](https://europass.europa.eu/system/files/2020-05/CEFR%20self-assessment%20grid%20EN.pdf).

I started studying Japanese (seriously) exactly one year ago, on April 30th, 2023, when I attended my first online class in a language school. Prior to that, I knew some of the basics like Hiragana and Katakana.

## Timeline

### Japanese Classes

During my first five months, my studies primarily consisted of:

+ ・N5 classes on the weekends (3 hours on Sat/Sun)
+ ・Vocabulary drills in my free time
+ ・Grammar lesson reviews
+ ・Rote Kanji writing
+ ・Translation drills

This was my standard routine from April to September. I was happy with my learning pace at school, but as you can see, it will take me forever to attain fluency if I stick to this.

For those unaware, there is a standardized test called the [JLPT (Japanese Language Proficiency Test)](https://www.jlpt.jp/e/index.html) which is held twice a year in July and December. There are five levels, N5 being the easiest and N1 the most difficult. I didn't think I was gonna make the cut in the July test, so I opted for the one in December.

After the JLPT in July, students from my language school complained of having encountered difficulties in the reading section in the actual test (i.e. the time was too short), so our school began incorporating _dokkai_ and _choukai_ (reading and listening comprehension) into our classes. The classes were specifically tailored to prepare us for these tests.

When we had our first listening comprehension quiz, I didn't understand a single thing. This gave us a preview of what to expect in the JLPT, and my listening comprehension was nil. I started easing in some listening reviews to my studies. It was hard to catch everything the first time as expected.

Overall, I was happy with the class and even made good friends among my classmates. After our classes ended in September, I signed up for N4 classes despite my N5 exam being scheduled for December.

I had a much harder time with the reading exercises due to the sharp increase in difficulty. Almost always, whenever we were having reading tests, I was last to finish among the class. Everyone else was significantly faster than me.

Because of this, I dreaded the reading comprehension tests. It felt like sludging through boring books, all because the majority of the vocab went over my head. I once scored 2 out of 7 on a reading test after giving it my all; needless to say, it was quite demoralizing. To compensate for this, I adapted stricter vocabulary and Kanji drills.

### JLPT N5

I took my [JLPT](https://www.jlpt.jp/e/index.html) N5 exam on December 3rd and attained the following scores:

+ ・Total Score: 110 / 180 (61.1%)
+ ・Vocabulary/Grammar + Reading: 79 / 120 (65.8%)
+ ・Listening: 31 / 60 (51.7%)
+ ・Percentile Rank: 80.5

Some of the grammar questions were tricky for beginners, and the test was noticeably more challenging than the mock exams I took in school. However, I found the reading comprehension section to be a breeze, thanks to the _dokkai_ drills that were incorporated into our classes later on.

As you can see in the results, listening is my weakness. The questions were only played once on a radio in front of the classroom. Still, I'm content with my performance.

(I understand that some people think the JLPT is a waste of time, i.e., one's proficiency is hardly defined by tests with flawed designs. Nonetheless, there is a sense of fulfilment and anticipation in these tests, and that is enough for me.)

## Immersion

At the start of 2024, I started hearing about [immersion](https://refold.la/simplified/stage-0/a/what-is-immersion) and [comprehensible input](https://www.sk.com.br/sk-krash-english.html) ([i+1](https://www.sk.com.br/sk-krash-english.html)). I became aware of [AJATT (All Japanese All The Time)](https://tatsumoto-ren.github.io/blog/whats-ajatt.html) methods, which discarded traditional textbook learning and endorsed single-handedly relying on intensive immersion through input to learn a language, paired with building your own flashcard deck on [Anki](https://apps.ankiweb.net/) which utilizes [spaced repetition](https://www.kpu.ca/sites/default/files/Learning%20Centres/Think_SpacedRepetition_LA.pdf).

However, I don't subscribe to some of AJATT's methods because they require a good amount of linguistic intuition, which I don't have, and I am fully aware that the level of intensity they demand will burn me out. I also believe that textbooks are helpful to an extent.

My listening practice started with [The Bite Size Japanese Podcast](https://open.spotify.com/show/58H68tM3uC2JNZI4hXvdeu) on the recommendation of my girlfriend. Her content is excellent for beginners; she speaks slowly, repeats words, and explores relatable, everyday topics. I spent weeks listening to her during my commutes. Reira-san helped me dip my toes into the initial hurdles of listening comprehension.

I was lucky that my favorite anime of all time, [Rascal Does Not Dream of Bunny Girl Senpai](https://myanimelist.net/anime/37450/Seishun_Buta_Yarou_wa_Bunny_Girl_Senpai_no_Yume_wo_Minai), is heavily dialogue-driven (the episodes consist of 95% conversations). To absorb each spoken line, I began manually transcribing the Japanese subtitles from Netflix straight to Google Docs, analyzing every single sentence and adding all the vocab I didn't know to my flashcard deck. I extracted and trimmed the audio using [audio software](https://www.audacityteam.org/), transferred the audio file to my phone, and repeatedly listened to it over and over _and over_ (at least 30 times).

> Side note: I was late to discover [Language Reactor](https://www.languagereactor.com/), a browser extension that allows you to export entire transcripts from Netflix and YouTube (including auto-generated subs). For my transcripts, I use this alongside pop-up web browser dictionaries like [Yomitan (PC)](https://github.com/themoeway/yomitan) and [10ten (iOS)](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/10ten-japanese-reader/id1573540634). These tools have been invaluable to my learning.
 
This was a game-changer for me. This specific method enhanced my listening comprehension x10. I love transcribing in general; it's the kind of labor I'm willing to grind whole weekends on. It was the riveting exchanges in this soothing slice of life that glued my attention to each spoken line, each amusing quip, each emotionally charged confession.

I did the exact same thing for the 2nd episode. I used my daily 2.5-hour commute to listen to these audio files. Before I hit the sack, I would also listen with my eyes closed until I started to feel sleepy.

After doing this for two episodes, I was suddenly comfortable with indulging in Japanese content with Japanese subtitles virtually everywhere else (anime, YouTube, etc.). Of course, I still didn't fully understand the content I was watching, but I had a rough idea of what was going on. This is the first time I understood the sweet spot of immersing in i+1 content (comprehensible input). I devoured as many Japanese media as I could. Some of my favorite channels are [あかね的日本語教室](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCh-GhnQ7qDQmS6Bz3pGc1Mw) and [Speak Japanese Naturally](https://www.youtube.com/@SpeakJapaneseNaturally).

### Methods

I combined Intensive, Free-Flow, and Passive Immersion methods into one. Here is my current process:

Free-Flow Immersion:

+ １）Watch a whole anime episode/YouTube video with Japanese subtitles with minimal to no pauses.

Active Immersion:

+ ２）In particularly interesting episodes/videos, strip the audio via torrent or converters, trim out the unnecessary parts using [Audacity](https://www.audacityteam.org/), and transfer the refined audio file to a phone.
+ ３）Generate the transcript from the subtitles using [Language Reactor](https://www.languagereactor.com/).
+ ４）Study each line and sentence intensively by looking up the definition of each new word and try to make sense of the sentence from its context.
+ ５）Add one flashcard to the [Anki](https://apps.ankiweb.net/) Japanese deck for every new unknown word that I find useful to learn.

Passive Immersion: 

+ ６）Listen and re-listen to the audio as many times as possible.
+ ７）Read and re-read the transcript as many times as possible.
+ ８）Simultaneously do 6 and 7 occasionally.

Having the audio available for transcripts facilitates reading comprehension. I also wrote Python scripts to automate raw transcript formatting (to my own liking) and hosted an unindexed site using markdown to easily access my transcripts wherever I was with any device connected to the internet.

This method is certainly not going to be effective for everyone in the same way some of AJATT's methods did not work for me. But this process works for me because 1) I enjoy the whole laborious process and 2) I have a _very low_ tolerance for ambiguity (i.e., I prefer to fully understand all the vocab and grammar in a transcript).

I cannot emphasize this enough: my methods are very personal to me, and this is what I find highly effective to do continuously and consistently. If you have a rough idea of how you would like to proceed with your study methods, whether they be Duolingo, language school, AJATT, Kanji writing, etc., I highly encourage you to do that and follow your heart.

My point is - my immersion methods bring me a tremendous amount of joy, and I strongly believe that the best way to learn a language is to have fun with how you learn, no matter how personalized your methods are. It's okay if you don't know yet which works for you - it took me a whole year to figure this out.

## Active Study

### Cure Dolly's Organic Japanese

I discovered [Organic Japanese with Cure Dolly](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCkdmU8hGK4Fg3LghTVtKltQ) (for readers like me, there is this [transcript version](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1XpuXerkGU8waJ4DPDNJA4bGeqOvM-csXjTe57iHARHc/edit)), which is arguably the best online lesson structure existing to get a crystal-clear understanding of Japanese grammatical foundations. The reason for this is that she teaches Japanese grammar and its nuances in the context of Japanese. (For instance, some school textbooks were obviously written in the context of English (and even Filipino) subtleties.)

Cure Dolly's lessons, along with my daily flashcard reps, serve only as a supplemental aid to my immersion, which is my primary method of study.

### Graded Readers / Children's Content

For a short while, before I transitioned to immersion, I tried graded readers. It taught me a thing or two, of course, but I didn't find them interesting enough to keep continuing. I felt the same with children's shows: my mind was too impatient to deal with the simplicity, so I kept getting distracted. Attention is a _very_ crucial element in language learning, and I've decided to discard every single study method that couldn't hold my focus.

If you're after simple vocabulary, I would argue that alternatives more befitting to adults exist, such as [this video introducing kitchen items](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz5oFor3lJM), for instance. Several channels churning out similar content exist across YouTube.

### Anki

I just use a single deck that has all the Japanese words, phrases, and grammar patterns I want to learn. All of the cards in my deck came from my own immersion. As of posting, I have 1,001 cards in my deck, and my goal by next year is to reach 10,000 cards.

I have two types of cards:

+ １）Vocab cards: The Kanji of the word in front. This comprises ~90% of my cards.
+ ２）Sentence cards with the highlighted word: For words with multiple definitions, I use sentences with the target word highlighted in front. This comprises ~10% of my cards.

This is the back template of my card:

+ ・Furigana of the vocab
+ ・Meaning of the word (English or Tagalog definition)
+ ・Sample sentence for context (no Furigana)

I treat Anki as nothing but vocab drills. With the Kanji in front, I try to guess the meaning and the reading of the word. For example:

+ Word: 魅力的
+ Reading: みりょくてき (miryokuteki)
+ Meaning: charming; fascinating; attractive

I prefer learning the Kanji of new words straight away because knowing only the meaning and the Kana of a word feels like a sluggish way to learn new vocab to me. And since single Kanji characters can have the same readings, as your vocabulary grows, it will be easier to remember other words and their readings because some of the Kanji will already be familiar.

Yes, it was uncomfortable to try memorizing so much Kanji in the beginning, so I started with 10 new cards/day before gradually increasing it to 20, which is my current setting.

I should note that I have no knowledge of the _onyomi_ and _kunyomi_ classifications of Kanji readings; if this is your preferred way of learning, however, by all means go ahead. 

I use the [FSRS algorithm](https://github.com/open-spaced-repetition/fsrs4anki) with a 90% retention rate and this has worked well for me. I can see myself continuing using Anki perhaps until I attain a good amount of vocab, but I think I will eventually discontinue using it (once I'm around B2 level maybe).

## Present

### Current routine

+ ・Waking up at 7:00 AM to complete my daily Anki flashcard drills (30 to 45 minutes) before getting up.
+ ・Dedicating most of my free time to consuming Japanese content with the active immersion method I mentioned in a few paragraphs above.
+ ・Free-flow listening immersion during 2-2.5 hours of commute and passive listening at work (during menial tasks only).
+ ・Chatting and talking in Japanese to my girlfriend (she is N2-level). お互いから学んでいます。
+ ・Studying at least one new grammar pattern a day via [Cure Dolly](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1XpuXerkGU8waJ4DPDNJA4bGeqOvM-csXjTe57iHARHc/edit) or [Nihongo Kyoshi JLPT Grammar](https://nihongokyoshi-net.com/jlpt-grammars/). Optional.
+ ・Sometimes answering an entire [JLPT listening set](https://www.youtube.com/@JLPTJapanese) without pauses to simulate test environments, and also studying listening sets that are one level above me as advanced conditioning.

Stuff I no longer do:

+ ・Eliminated Kanji rote writing from my routine altogether. (Hand)writing is effective for some people - I'm just not one of them. I find mnemonics to be more effective, but I don't spend a lot of time thinking about that.

### An honest rating of my present skills

+ １）Reading: **A2**. I can't read light novels continuously yet, but I am comfortable with reading extensive passages in N4-level reading comprehension tests.
+ ２）Listening: **A2**. I can understand what's going on most of the time in simple conversations and monologues, but I might miss some of the vocab occasionally.
+ ３）Writing (typing): **A2**. I can hold a conversation with my girlfriend with a bit of mental effort. I may be able to write a letter.
+ ４）Speaking: **A1**. It takes me a long while to form simple, descriptive sentences.

Having poured a lot of my time into the language in the past year, I still consider myself an upper beginner.

## 2nd Year Plans

・**Start reading novels.** As someone who reads English content voraciously and heavily prefers ebooks over audiobooks, reading Japanese content presently bores me. I am not as enthusiastic when it comes to reading materials as I am when listening to audio material while reading the transcript/subtitles, but I cannot deny the effectiveness and importance of reading. For my second year, I plan to indulge in light novels from start to finish and then listen to their respective audiobooks repeatedly.

・**Watch native-level Japanese content without Japanese subtitles.** Native-level Japanese dialogue without the aid of Japanese subtitles is a different behemoth in itself. As someone who's dependent on English subtitles when watching English media, this will probably be the most difficult aspect of input.

・**Integrate output to my everyday life.** I will probably start writing Japanese essays every day for a few months, but I'm still figuring out a sustainable approach. I will post about my methods next year once I figure them out.

・**Study Kansai dialect.** My girlfriend currently lives in the Kansai Region, so the specific domain of Kansai dialect is one of our top choices among other language specializations. Moreover, I think only a small minority of Japanese learners pay attention to the Kansai dialect.

・**My ultimate goal is C1 level: conversational fluency and university-level literacy.** I have no delusions that it will take me a long time to attain this - five years or more, at the very least. It may even take me an entire lifetime. Language learning is very tough, but I am pleased with my current progress.

・**Live in Japan and talk to the natives.** Of course, this is the be-all and end-all goal of language learning - to assimilate yourself to the natives and learn everything about their culture and life.

## Takeaways

These are the things I would tell myself a year ago.

・**Language schools can give you a solid framework on how to start and continue with your studies**, but their pedagogical efficacy differs from person to person. The N5 class was worth it, but you can stop from there and learn everything else on your own. You may lose a lot of motivation if you attain low scores on tests. Vocab drills without sentence context are not as effective as learning words with sentence context. However, schools are a rich source of learning material and resources for your own studies. Ultimately, language schools are merely _supplemental_ to your main learning methods.

・**Learn Japanese the Japanese way and don't translate everything you read to English**. Translation drills can lead to unnatural sentence structures. Also, there is such a thing as over-reliance on Google Translate. I highly recommend trying to analyze more complex sentences on your own first, with Google Translate only serving as a last resort.

・**Japanese words have a life of their own and cannot be completely defined by their closest English translation**, except for discrete nouns like 犬 (dog), パソコン (laptop), or 自動販売機 (vending machine). For example, the word 面白い (omoshiroi) means "funny", but it also means "interesting". Some words don't even have direct translations; they can only be grasped by the context in which they are used.

・**You don't always have to immerse in material with comprehensible input (i+1)**. Sometimes, you can listen to something way more challenging than your current level. The important thing is you are _thoroughly enjoying the material_ enough for you to listen to it over and over and over. If repetition is the mother of retention, enjoyment is definitely the father.

・**Output is important, but output can wait.** I believe there is some truth in getting enough input first before starting on output. I only started immersion less than four months ago, but when I'm practising speaking at my current level, the words are beginning to come out much more naturally than ever.

・**Some people will be much better at output at a much earlier stage**, but I like to think they're exceptionally talented. This point will be fringe and inarticulate, so take it with a grain of salt. My patterns of output are much more "emulative" than they are "creative" in that, my speaking feels way more natural when I "imitiate" other people's speaking rather than creating sentences in my own mind before saying them. I feel the exact same way with English, which is why my speaking output came much later than my writing output.

### Random Musings

・**Japanese is a beautiful language and a lot of Japanese media is lost in translation**. You can criticize Haruki Murakami's writing all you want, but you'll understand the beauty of his prose once you learn the language he writes with. To capture that beauty with translation is purely impossible.

・**Technology has immensely facilitated the study of languages**, and we are very fortunate to be living in modern times. Take the time to learn how to use them as early as possible. And with the dawn of AI, there has never been a better time to learn a new language.

・**I initially thought I would never attain my current level of fluency in English.** This keeps me optimistic that I will eventually acquire Japanese. While yes, I thought of myself as an eloquent writer during my formative years, my writing pieces during that time were quite unnatural since I hardly spoke the language. I learned how to write much more organically by speaking a lot more - it's true when they say that anybody who can talk can also write.

・**The phonetics of Japanese and Tagalog are very similar** since they are both _syllable-timed_ languages, whereas English is a _stress-timed_ language, so its pronunciation was much easier to digest for me.
